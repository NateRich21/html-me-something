                        <h3>2010</h3>
                        <p>Tame Impala's studio debut exploded onto the rock scene in 2010. Drawing inspiration from traditional psych-rock prisms,
the band managed to not only  recreate the genre's signature, vintage sound, but also reinvent it. Using current tech to add a modern twist on
a vintage sound, Tame Impala created an original, brilliant piece of work.</p>

                        <h3>2012</h3>
                        <p>Lonerism is Tame Impala's exciting progression from Innerspeaker. By bringing more synths into the mix for the band's
sophmore album, Kevin Parker yet again gives an exciting update to an already exciting sound. While not being anything close to an edm album,
Lonerism's songs are structured like electronic music; eacha track is treated as a blank canvas to be filled with fluidity, contant motion and 
textural evolution. Parker also gives a taste of affinity for writing brilliant, yet catch melodies throughout the body of work.</p>

                        <h3>2015</h3>
                        <p>Currents is radically different from the band's other LPs. Kevin Parker personally wrote, played, recorded, produced and
mixed every single note on the album. Rather than suppressing his instincts for pop melodies, Parker fully embraces them and creates a body of work
that is equally accesible and brilliant. Mo-town, R&#38B, soul, funk, and new-wave all find themselves masterfully and delicately intertwined with 
psych-rock's vintage kaleidoscope of sound creating one of the most sonically thrilling and unique albums of the last ten years.
